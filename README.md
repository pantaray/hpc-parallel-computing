# hpc-parallel-computing
Parallel Compupting Demos for the ESI HPC Cluster

## Structure

The example Jupyter notebooks are intended to be run (and presented) on
the ESI HPC cluster, while the Python modules provide the computational
backbone for the notebooks. The codes cover two thematic areas:

1. Newton Fractals (`fractal-demo.ipynb`, `fractal-parallel.ipynb`, `newton_tools.py`)
2. Functional Connectomics (`neuro-demo.ipynb`, `neuro-parallel.ipynb`, `nilearn_tools.py`)

Both topics are independent of each other and can be analyzed/presented
independently.

## Usage

Pick a topic and start with the `*-demo.ipynb` notebook. Then discuss the
`*-parallel.ipynb` case.
